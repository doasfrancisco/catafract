## What is Catafract?

Catafract is a Next.js-based platform that combines AI image generation with an intuitive node-based interface. Using Google's Gemini API, you can:

- **Upload images** to use as inputs for generation
- **Connect nodes** to create visual workflows
- **Generate AI images** with custom prompts
- **Manage projects** with automatic canvas state persistence
- **Track your work** with integrated analytics

The platform uses Azure Cosmos DB for data storage, Azure Blob Storage for image hosting, and includes authentication via Google OAuth through NextAuth.
